# What for

Carty is an integrated tool to create, edit, review and test Sling mappings for Adobe CQ/AEM. No more switching between Felix Console and CRX DE tabs to check if the mappings finally work as expected. No more guessing why given URL resolves to a content path or vice versa - Carty will tell exactly which entries has been applied to a given path and why. You may use an automatic mapping generator (just enter domain and content path) or manually edit your configuration if you need more precise control.

# Features

* mapping generator - enter domain and the content path and Carty will take of everything else,
* mapping editor - edit, move, create and delete sling:Mapping entries,
* tester - check what will be the result of the map or resolve operation,
* highlighter - Carty explains which entries have been applied to a specific part of the tested URL,
* configuration - you may choose any path to create mappings, it doesn't have to be the mapping root currently set in the Resource Resolver

# Installation

Download the package and install it via the CQ package manager or compile and install from sources:

    mvn clean package crx:install

Optionally, you may set Maven properties: `instance.url`, `instance.login` and `instance.password`.

# Usage

Find Carty in the *Tools* menu (`/miscadmin`) or enter the Carty path directly: `/etc/carty.html`.
